# SQL Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my **SQL Portfolio**, a collection of real-world projects designed to demonstrate my skills in writing efficient, structured SQL queries for data exploration, reporting, and decision-making.

Each project is designed to reflect business problems and includes:
- Database schema
- Analytical SQL queries
- Business insights
- Use of joins, window functions, CTEs, and subqueries
